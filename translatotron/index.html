      <h1>Audio samples from "Direct speech-to-speech translation with a sequence-to-sequence model" (Translatotron)</h1>

      <p><b>Paper:</b> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.06037">arXiv</a></p>
      <p><b>Authors:</b> Ye Jia &ast;, Ron J. Weiss &ast;, Fadi Biadsy, Wolfgang Macherey, Melvin Johnson, Zhifeng Chen, Yonghui Wu.</p>
      <p><b>Abstract:</b>
        We present an attention-based sequence-to-sequence neural network which can directly translate speech from one language into speech in another language, without relying on an intermediate text representation. The network is trained end-to-end, learning to map speech spectrograms into target spectrograms in another language, corresponding to the translated content (in a different canonical voice). We further demonstrate the ability to synthesize translated speech using the voice of the source speaker. We conduct experiments on two Spanish-to-English speech translation datasets, and find that the proposed model slightly underperforms a baseline cascade of a direct speech-to-text translation model and a text-to-speech synthesis model, demonstrating the feasibility of the approach on this very challenging task.
